## Key concepts 

- **Workflow**: A set of automated steps defined in a [YAML file](./workflow-file.md).  
- **Event (Trigger)**: Something that starts the workflow (push/issue/pull request ..).  
- **Job**: A group of steps that run on a runner (virtual machine).  
- **Step**: A single task in a job (run a command/use an action).
